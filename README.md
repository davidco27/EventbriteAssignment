# EventbriteAssignment
The main page is https://davidco27.github.io/EventbriteAssignment/home.html which displays all the events I created. This page contains multiple filters that allow the user to show and hide online and physical events and select the location of the events to be displayed (in this case Madrid or San Francisco). The user has to click on the Filter Events button so that the filters can take effect.

If the user clicks on a particular event, it will be taken to the event page which provides more detailed information about the event like the description. It also contains a Buy Tickets button which when pressed takes the user to the page used to buy tickets.
